<h1>Androids are far better than IOS.<h1>
<p>1. Customization: Android allows for a higher level of customization. Users can change home screen layouts, use widgets, and even install alternative launchers to personalize the user experience to a greater extent than iOS.</p>

2. Variety of Hardware Options: Android devices come in various shapes, sizes, and price points, giving consumers more choices in terms of hardware. This means you can find Android devices that fit your budget and specific requirements.
3. Open Ecosystem: Android has a more open ecosystem, which can be an advantage for developers and power users who want more control over their devices. You can sideload apps from outside the official app stores and access the file system more freely.
4. Google Services Integration: Android is tightly integrated with Google services, which can be a significant advantage if you're heavily invested in the Google ecosystem (Gmail, Google Photos, Google Drive, etc.).
5. Multitasking: Android traditionally offers more robust multitasking capabilities, making it easier to switch between apps and perform various tasks simultaneously.
6. Affordability: Android devices come in a wide range of price points, including budget-friendly options, which can be appealing for cost-conscious consumers.
7. Expandable Storage: Many Android devices offer the option to expand storage via microSD cards, which can be essential for users who require a lot of storage space.
